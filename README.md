LIVE PREVIEW: CoMtnMan.github.io/google-homepage-clone

This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations course. The goal is to recreate the Google Homepage, building on the skills learned thus far.  

Basic HTML structure Two ways to move a div around the page (grid and flex) Stick a dive onto the bottom or top of the page Identify the background color of an existing webpage Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage Center an element horizontally Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page (inline style attribute, embedded <style> element and external element) Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page Build a very basic form (even if it doesn't "go" anywhere)  

Project date: February 2021  

Assignment Easy Version: Build the Google.com homepage (the simple one with just a search box).  

Inside your project folder, create your index.html file  

Tips: DON’T BE A PERFECTIONIST! You’re just trying to make it look like google.com, not actually function like it and it doesn’t have to be spaced exactly the same way to the pixel. Any dropdown menus or form submissions or hover-highlighting should be ignored.  

USE GOOGLE! You’ll probably run into roadblocks where you can’t figure out how to do something so do what all good devs do… Google it! Now is a good time to set up the live server extension in VSCode, if you haven’t already.  

If you’re frustrated with trying to get buttons or inputs to style the way you want (for instance, they seem to just not respond to any styles), look into the CSS property -webkit-appearance: none; or -moz-appearance if you’re using Firefox.  

Here’s a link to the Google Logo just in case they temporarily replace it with a Doodle!  

Here’s a cached page of the Google home page for reference in case the original logo is not there. https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759if_/https://www.google.com/  

Start with just putting the main elements on the page (the logo image and search form), then get them placed horizontally. You can either download the Google logo or link directly to its URL on the web in your  tag.  

Next do the navbar across the top, first building the content and then trying to position it. Check out how to build a horizontal CSS navbar if you’re lost.  

Finally, put in the footer, which should be very similar to the top navbar.  

In general, do as much on your own as you can before relying on the developer tools (or viewing the page’s source code) to help you along.  

Push your project to GitHub using the instructions above! Then consider sharing your project with the community by submitting a link to your repository in the Solutions section below.  

Difficult Version (optional): Build the Google.com search results page You should be able to reuse much of your code from before if you started with that project. Again, don’t worry about links to nowhere and forms that won’t submit and hard coding the search results (which you’ll have to do of course), just focus on placement and order of items on the page.  

Note: All the classes and id’s and names of elements that you inspect on Google’s home page are nonsensical strings (like). This is because the code was Minified (see the Wikipedia entry here), which removes or shortens unnecessary characters and names to help the page load faster. The HTML (or JavaScript or CSS) file will be smaller but the browser can still read it just fine.
